//        Features of static method:
//
//        A static method in Java is a method that is part of a class rather than an instance of that class.
//        Every instance of a class has access to the method.
//        Static methods have access to class variables (static variables) without using the classâ€™s object (instance).
//                Only static data may be accessed by a static method. It is unable to access data that is not static (instance variables).
//        In both static and non-static methods, static methods can be accessed directly.
